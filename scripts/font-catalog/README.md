# Classic font catalog pins

The browser inventory derives from Classic commit
`cf5e79e919144200294fb9fed22a222592a0aeea`, file
`apps/web/public/fonts/font-atlas.json` (SHA256
`1582a3ebae342be98c3f6e7b8b7b6a4521c7fda019bca7fca33d74d7d71ade0f`).
Its 1,920 Google family entries declare weights/styles. The nine Classic system
families are visible but unavailable for redistribution; no system lookup occurs.

Sources are the unchanged Google Fonts commit
`66928797f271fed5ee428544e7229685e2d90127`. The source tree JSON must be complete
(`truncated=false`). Regeneration downloads only matching static normal/italic
400/700 faces with a supported original OFL or Apache license. It verifies the
font and license Git blob identities against that tree, inspects declared sfnt
family/weight/style, records SHA256/size, and retains each full original license.
Original B1 Lato/Ma Shan Zheng IDs and content identities remain fixed.
Discovery includes historical unnamed static files and `static/` subdirectories.
Admissible original root faces retain priority, so newly discovered files never
replace an existing catalog identity. This extension preserved all 1,797 earlier
records and added 39 faces across 35 families; 621 families still lack a pinned
400 normal face.

The current result is 1,836 pinned static faces across 1,299 families. 117
candidate static faces fail exact declared identity or native static-render support checks and remain excluded
with reasons in `catalog_source_report.json`. The actual native scan found 12
color/bitmap faces, two invalid table checksums and four nonzero italic-angle
faces mislabeled as Regular; `catalog_native_report.json` preserves those
failures and a successful complete 1,836-face native scan. The browsing inventory reports
1,490 applicable faces without a matching pinned static source, 4,348 weights
that TextV4 cannot express, and 36 unavailable system faces. Inventory presence
is not successful import/render proof. Variable sources use the separately pinned
recipes below. UFL fonts, unpinned families and unsupported weights have no
implicit substitute.

Regenerate using a cache outside the repository; urllib retains the configured
proxy environment. Obtain the complete fixed tree from the official GitHub API:
`https://api.github.com/repos/google/fonts/git/trees/66928797f271fed5ee428544e7229685e2d90127?recursive=1`.

```sh
python3 scripts/font-catalog/generate.py \
  --tree /tmp/opencut-google-fonts-tree.json \
  --cache /tmp/opencut-b3-font-cache --workers 20
python3 scripts/font-catalog/check.py
```

Successful sources are read from cache; a rerun downloads only missing sources.
No font binaries are committed. The generated Rust catalog and notices are
reviewable text; `browser_catalog.json` is the lightweight complete inventory.

The integrator may run the offline native parser test using the same cache:

```sh
OPENCUT_FONT_CATALOG_CACHE=/tmp/opencut-b3-font-cache \
  cargo test -p opencut-native-services \
  every_pinned_classic_static_face_matches_native_inspector -- --ignored
```

This checks every actual face's hash/size and native parsed family/weight/style.
It does not prove arbitrary text coverage or independent rendered pixels; normal
import/render still rechecks coverage for the current required text.

## Pinned variable-font recipes

`generate_derived_catalog.py` discovers the remaining applicable variable faces
from the same fixed tree. It retains original source and license identities,
every axis coordinate, exact Python/fontTools implementation identity, canonical
derivation proof and static output hash/size. The original 1,836 static records
keep priority. Successful recipe/output evidence is resumed from the external
cache; four independent derivation processes avoid Python's thread contention.

```sh
/absolute/path/to/pinned-python scripts/font-catalog/generate_derived_catalog.py \
  --tree /tmp/opencut-google-fonts-tree.json \
  --cache /tmp/opencut-b3-font-cache \
  --evidence /tmp/opencut-font-derived-catalog \
  --workers 16 --derive-workers 4
```

The host exposes `opencut_font_catalog`, `source`, `import`, `proof`
and recovery `stage/read/ack` operations. Install the runtime recorded in
`derived-runtime-lock.json` (Python 3.14.7 and the exact fontTools 4.61.1 wheel
in `fonttools-lock.json`), then configure the host with absolute paths:

```sh
export OPENCUT_FONT_DERIVE_PYTHON=/absolute/path/to/pinned-python
export OPENCUT_FONT_DERIVE_SCRIPT=/absolute/path/to/OpenCut/scripts/font-catalog/run_derived.py
export OPENCUT_FONT_DERIVE_CACHE=/tmp/opencut-b3-font-cache
"$OPENCUT_FONT_DERIVE_PYTHON" -I -B "$OPENCUT_FONT_DERIVE_SCRIPT" --identity
```

The wrapper and its sibling algorithm files must match the running binary.
Runtime availability is reported separately from catalog presence. Public source
downloads retain the existing opt-in `OPENCUT_ALLOW_PUBLIC_FONT_DOWNLOAD=1`;
the default is offline. No project text or media is sent to the font source.
Exact cached outputs live at `derived/<output-sha256>`. Imports still check
native face metadata and requested glyph coverage, publish to authorized CAS,
and commit immutable provenance atomically with the project edit. Project
rendering then uses the committed CAS resource independently of downloads.

The native child has a 20-second CPU limit, a 32-MiB output limit and the original
import deadline. Linux applies a 2-GiB address-space limit; macOS uses a sampled
resident-memory watchdog, not a hard memory quota. Offline batch derivation does
not establish that every recipe finishes within the host's runtime budget.
Reserved Font Name sources needing renaming, unsupported color/bitmap tables
and sources exceeding the existing envelope remain explicit gaps.

The integrator can inspect all pinned derived outputs without downloading or
deriving again:

```sh
OPENCUT_FONT_DERIVED_CACHE=/tmp/opencut-b3-font-cache \
  cargo test -p opencut-native-services \
  every_pinned_derived_face_matches_native_inspector -- --ignored
```

That inventory checks each pinned output's bytes and native static-face metadata.
The actual public import, saved proof and independent rendering still need their
own recorded candidate evidence; no font binaries belong in the repository.
